# FuturixImager

Back in 2001-03 **FuturixImager** used to be a Top 5 photo viewer/editor for Windows. But things have changed, photo viewers are now included with all decent operating systems - so I stopped updating Imager somewhere around 2009. It didn't help that I wrote it in Delphi (an ancient programming language that I grew to dislike) - and upgrade prices for the recent versions of it are simply outrageous.

However I don't want Imager to disappear completely, and I think it might be a good idea to release its source code to the public. It is fairly useless due to a dependency on a commercial third-party graphic library - but some parts can still be useful as a source of various tips and tricks on how to (or *not* to!) write a decent application in Delphi.
